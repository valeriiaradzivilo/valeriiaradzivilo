## My Flutter packages:
- [Linter Class Match File Name](https://pub.dev/packages/class_match_file_name)

This package provides a custom linter rule to ensure that the file name and the class name within it are consistent. This can be particularly useful during refactoring, as it helps maintain a clear and organized codebase by enforcing naming conventions. By automatically checking and suggesting fixes for mismatched names, this linter aids in reducing errors and improving code readability.
